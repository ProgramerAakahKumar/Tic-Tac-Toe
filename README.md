# Tic-Tac-Toe
The primary objective of this project is to develop a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that serves both as a recreational tool and as a demonstration of modern web development techniques. This game allows users to play against each other in a familiar game format while showcasing responsive design and interactivity.
